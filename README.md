# Old-Car-Price-Predictor
The automotive industry has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, with the demand for cars increasing significantly. As a result, car price prediction has become an important application of machine learning in the industry. Predicting the price of a car is a complex task that requires the analysis of various factors that affect the price. Machine learning algorithms can help in analyzing these factors and predicting the price of a car accurately. And in this project, we will discuss the process of predicting the price of a car using machine learning algorithms![image](https://github.com/akarshxydv/Old-Car-Price-Predictor/assets/79755154/490bddb0-bfd1-4138-9f3e-03ba8f0e1973)
